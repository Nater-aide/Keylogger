# Keylogger

If the “keyboard” module is not available on your system, we can use pip3 to install it.
**pip3 install keyboard**

“keyboard.record” will record the keys until ENTER is pressed, and “keyboard.play” will replay them. As this script is logging keystrokes, any edit using backspace will also be seen.
